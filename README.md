# MandelPlot

MandelPlot is a fractal generator that displays the Mandelbrot set and
allows the user to explore it.  It is written in CoffeeScript
(compiled to JavaScript) and runs in the user's web browser.

It has been tested on recent versions of Firefox and Chrome.  Other
modern web browsers may also work.

# Trying It

Since this is a browser app, you can try it out just by going to
<http://www.blit.ca/mandelplot/mandel.html>.

# Installation

To install:

1. Unpack the archive.

2. Run 'make' if you have it installed.  If not, you can just run
   'coffee -cb' on all of the .coffee files.

3. Copy mandel.html and all of the .js files to a public HTML directory.

4. (Optional) Download a copy of jquery and edit mandel.html to
   use it instead of the one provided by Google.
