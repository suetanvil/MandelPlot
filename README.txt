                              ==========

MandelPlot is a fractal generator that displays the Mandelbrot set and
allows the user to explore it.  It is written in CoffeeScript
(compiled to JavaScript) and runs in the user's web browser.

It has been tested on Firefox 12.0 and Chrome 18.0.  Other modern web
browsers may also work.


Trying It
=========

Since this is a browser app, you can try it out just by going to
<http://www.blit.ca/mandelplot/mandel.html>.


Installation
============

To install:

    1) Unpack the archive.

    2) Run 'make' if you have it installed.  If not, you can just run
       'coffee -cb' on all of the .coffee files.

    3) Copy mandel.html and all of the .js files to a public HTML directory.

    4) (Optional) Download a copy of jquery and edit mandel.html to
       use it instead of the one provided by Google.
